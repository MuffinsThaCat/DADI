## Mock Implementation

The `MockWalletService` provides a comprehensive test implementation that:
- Simulates all wallet operations without blockchain dependencies
- Provides predictable responses for testing
- Implements proper error handling
- Supports delayed operations for async testing

## Platform-Specific Testing

Tests are designed to handle the unique aspects of each platform:
- Web: Browser storage, MetaMask integration
- Mobile: Secure storage, biometric authentication
- Cross-platform: Common wallet functionality

## Test Implementation Approach

1. **Interface-Based Testing**: All tests are written against the `WalletServiceInterface`
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are provided via Provider for UI testing
3. **Isolated Tests**: Each test file focuses on specific functionality
4. **Comprehensive Error Testing**: All error conditions are explicitly tested
5. **Widget Testing**: UI components are tested with mock services

## Future Test Improvements

1. Integration with test blockchain networks
2. Performance benchmarking for wallet operations
3. Security penetration testing
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing
5. Expanded UI test coverage

## Best Practices Implemented

1. Clear test organization and naming
2. Comprehensive documentation
3. Proper test setup and teardown
4. Predictable mock behavior
5. Thorough error condition testing
