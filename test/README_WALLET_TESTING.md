# DADI Web3 Wallet Service Testing Infrastructure

This document provides an overview of the testing infrastructure for the DADI Web3 Auction Platform's wallet service implementation.

## Testing Architecture

The wallet service testing infrastructure is designed to provide comprehensive test coverage for all wallet-related functionality across different platforms (Web, iOS, Android). The testing approach follows these key principles:

1. **Interface-Based Testing**: Tests are primarily written against the `WalletServiceInterface` to ensure consistent behavior across implementations.
2. **Platform-Specific Testing**: Separate test files for web and mobile implementations address platform-specific behaviors.
3. **Mock Implementation**: A fully functional mock wallet service provides predictable behavior for testing without external dependencies.
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error condition testing ensures the application gracefully handles edge cases.
5. **Factory Pattern Testing**: Tests for the wallet service factory ensure correct implementation selection based on platform.

## Test Files Overview

### Core Test Files

- **wallet_service_test.dart**: Tests the core wallet service functionality against the interface.
- **wallet_service_factory_test.dart**: Tests the factory pattern for creating the appropriate wallet service implementation.
- **wallet_service_mobile_test.dart**: Tests mobile-specific wallet functionality.
- **wallet_service_web_test.dart**: Tests web-specific wallet functionality.
- **wallet_service_mock.dart**: Provides a mock implementation of the wallet service interface.
- **wallet_service_mock_test.dart**: Tests the mock implementation to ensure it behaves correctly.
- **wallet_error_handling_test.dart**: Tests error conditions and exception handling.

## Mock Wallet Service

The `MockWalletService` class provides a self-contained implementation of the `WalletServiceInterface` that doesn't depend on external blockchain libraries. Key features include:

- Simulated wallet creation, import, and reset operations
- Predictable transaction history generation
- Configurable initialization delay for testing async behavior
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid operations
- State management via `ChangeNotifier`

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on isolated functionality:
- Wallet creation and management
- Transaction operations
- Import/export functionality
- Error handling

### Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure components work together:
- Wallet service with UI components
- State management across the application
- Platform-specific implementations

## Error Handling Testing

The error handling tests verify that the wallet service properly handles:
- Operations on non-existent wallets
- Operations on locked wallets
- Invalid password attempts
- Insufficient balance conditions
- Export operations with invalid credentials

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Web Testing

Web tests address:
- Browser-specific wallet storage
- Integration with browser-based Web3 providers
- MetaMask and other extension compatibility

### Mobile Testing

Mobile tests address:
- Secure storage on mobile devices
- Biometric authentication integration
- Mobile-specific key management

## Running Tests

Run all wallet service tests with:

```bash
flutter test test/wallet_service_test.dart test/wallet_service_factory_test.dart test/wallet_service_mobile_test.dart test/wallet_service_web_test.dart test/wallet_service_mock_test.dart test/wallet_error_handling_test.dart
```

Run specific test files individually:

```bash
flutter test test/wallet_service_test.dart
```

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements to the testing infrastructure include:
1. Integration with actual blockchain test networks
2. Performance testing for wallet operations
3. Security testing for wallet storage
4. UI integration tests for wallet management screens
5. Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Best Practices

When extending the wallet service or tests:
1. Always write tests against the interface when possible
2. Use the mock implementation for UI testing
3. Test error conditions thoroughly
4. Consider platform-specific behaviors
5. Ensure proper cleanup after tests
